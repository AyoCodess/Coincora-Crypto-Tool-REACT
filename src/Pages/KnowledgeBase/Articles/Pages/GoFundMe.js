                  findings show that cryptocurrency crime had a record-breaking
                  year in 2021. With scammers devouring $14 billion worth of
                  crypto.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That‚Äôs affecting real people with real lives, families and

                <p>
                  Because I couldn‚Äôt stand seeing more people suffer at the
                  hands of unethical crypto scammers, I went all-in on creating
                  an app that aims to empower and protect investors by lowering
                  risk and ambiguity - with a reliable investment tool and
                  relevant education.

                <h3 id='myStory'>Who's Ayo</h3>

                <p>
                  Originally from London, I am currently based in Sweden with my
                  partner - who‚Äôs a psychosomatic therapist by trade.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  To cut a long but inspiring story short (hit me up if you want
                  to hear the non-abridged version), I have a speech impediment.
                  A medium to severe (depending on the situation)
                  stutter/stammer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For most of my life, it debilitated me personally and
                  professionally. Almost leading me to the point of no return in
                  December 2016.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thankfully, I found a way out of that and now help run a
                  charity supporting people who suffer from stuttering called
                  Stop Holding Back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In May 2020, I quit a relatively good-paying job as a train
                  signal technician and left my friends and family behind - for
                  a shot at love with someone I met online who lived in Sweden.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  All in the middle of Brexit and ehrm, a global pandemic. I
                  know, I know, some of you will think I‚Äôm crazy for it üòÅ
                  (spoiler, despite some hurdles, it did work out in the end).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Speaking of hurdles, there I was, in a foreign country where I
                  couldn't speak the language, and my previous job skills
                  weren‚Äôt readily applicable.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this messy uncertainty, I was forced to try and reconnect
                  with my true desires and figure out what I wanted to do in
                  life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a lot of banging my head against a wall and a few mild
                  anxiety attacks, I began remembering my passion for coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea of using technology to create something that never
                  existed before intrinsically motivated me like nothing else.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  To me, coding has always felt like a sort of alchemy: the
                  process of turning an abstract vision in my head into
                  something tangible and valuable that makes a difference.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I said yes to this career path, I realised it's like a
                  superpower that was always available to me. I only had to
                  commit, do the work, and claim it. So I did (or attempting to,
                  haha).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In March 2021, I took the plunge and went 'all in' on coding.
                  I taught myself how to code to a level where I could build
                  interactive websites and basic web apps. Check this out!

                <p>
                  I'm super excited about where I'm heading with coding, but I‚Äôm
                  at a place where the vision is too great for me to implement
                  all on my own. That‚Äôs where you come in, friend.

                  Coincora is a coin forecasting tool and information hub for
                  traversing the crypto market safely and securely.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  It allows you to compare and analyse the crypto market quickly

                <p>
                  Simplicity is the central core value at play here. Coincora

                  perplexed, and instead offers a seamless and intuitive user

                  Like many crypto early adopters, I and countless others have
                  been ruthlessly scammed.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sadly, our minds got hijacked by all kinds of charismatic
                  influencers. They promised we‚Äôd ‚Äúget to the moon‚Äù if we
                  invested $500 in X coin and ‚Äúturn it into $100,000 before ‚Äòthe

                  If that doesn‚Äôt sound too familiar to you, you‚Äôre either very

                <p>
                  Around 0.0001% of all crypto investors who fell for this trick
                  may have landed safely on the moon.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the rest of us, the 99.999%, didn't even take off. We‚Äôre
                  still down here licking our wounds from all the money and
                  opportunities lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of us lost everything we had, including our trust in the
                  integrity of the crypto space as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Leaving us so traumatised by the experience that we‚Äôre scared

                <p>
                  From this hurt place, it would be easy to assume that all of
                  crypto is a scam. But I assure you, it‚Äôs not.{' '}

                  Crypto doesn‚Äôt mind where you‚Äôre from or what gender,
                  educational level, or race you are - it‚Äôs inherently
