                  Bitcoin, since the inception of crypto, has led all other

                <p>In simple terms, if Bitcoin goes up, so do altcoins. </p>
                <p>
                  The same dynamic is true for the opposite direction. If
                  Bitcoin goes down, altcoins drop just as fast, if not faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is why it’s useful to understand Bitcoin’s market cap and
                  how its behaviour influences the rest of the crypto market as
                  a whole.

                  An altcoin’s current market cap size in relation to bitcoin’s
                  - coupled with its ‘fundamentals’ - should influence how,
                  when, and what amount you choose to invest.

                <p>
                  Fundamentals are what hold a crypto project together. They
                  help you estimate the authenticity and objective value of a
                  coin by looking at a wide range of factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Coincora’s opinion, investing in crypto should be primarily
                  based on the fundamentals of the coin

                  The RBM can be a useful tool (depending on your investment
                  strategy) to help you assess if a coin is a worthwhile
                  investment.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                  RBM is particularly useful for long-term investment decisions:
                  investments that look at crypto from a 3 to 10-year scope.
